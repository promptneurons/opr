# OPR: Organization Process Re-engineering

Architecture and specifications for Organization Process Re-engineering using Agentic AI.

## Overview

OPR applies compiler semantics to organizational transformation. Just as GCC compiles source code to machine code across different architectures, OPR compiles organizational specifications to running agent systems.

**The YOLOD Principle:** Your Organization Lives One Day

## Key Concepts

- **Mindspace**: Organizational structure, metadata, ontologies (outer loop)
- **Modelspace**: Operational content, instances, agent state (inner loop)  
- **Canonical Triple**: arch-vendor-os → model-runtime-standards
- **Petri Nets**: Formal representation of organizational workflows
- **NWP Analogy**: Numerical Weather Prediction as model for Organizational Intelligence
